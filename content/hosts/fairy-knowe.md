Get a Fish Eagle’s view from a paraglider, a Cormorant’s perspective from a kayak, or channel your inner leopard by taking a tree adventure course.

Canyoning, abseiling and horse riding are all on the cards too, so bring your best exploring shoes (and some post-adventure Arnica for those muscles if you’ve been desk-bound for too long).

Whatever your flavour, Fairy Knowe Adventures will sort you out with the best guides, best equipment and best prices.
