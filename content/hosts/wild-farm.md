"We are located 15 minutes drive from the N2 and Wilderness the center of the Garden Route of South Africa. We have the best accommodation prices in the garden route and lots of different options! The magnificent views and landscapes you will experience here is incomparable and unique !

We are located in between the Wilderness National Park and the Map of Africa. NB: The Wild Farm is situated on an farm on the hills of Wilderness!! It takes 15 min to drive up the hill and the last bit of road is very bumpy! Only for the adventure travelers. Take it slow and enjoy the scenery on the way up, once you get there it will be worth it!! The Wild Farm in Wilderness has some of the best sunsets imaginable in the world as we view south west over Indian ocean! The garden route has many great views and the Wild Farm gives you plenty of that from the east of the lakes till the Outeniqua mountains in the north! We have a fully licensed bar and regularly have some fun evenings on a Friday or Saturday night!

Wilderness has variety of activities that you can enjoy like hiking on the many trails and beaches! Many other sports like mountain biking, surfing, kite surfing, and swimming! The wilderness beach stretches for over 30 kilometers!

Eat delicious wood fired pizzas with home made pizza bases. mmmmmmmm The Garden Route National Park Wilderness section is one of the most amazing places to spend a day canoeing and hiking in indigenous forest! Paragliding in Wilderness is also really an amazing activity to enjoy. There are many great flights that one can explore! Mossel Bay is one hours drive west and Plettenberg Bay is one hours drive East."
