"Ideally situated on the Garden Route (Cape Town & Port Elizabeth), between George & Knysna, along one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world.

Nestled in a grove of Milkwood trees, overlooking charming Leentjiesklip, the Beach House offers a welcome haven for the travel weary backpacker and adventure tourist alike.

Light and airy, this old house has beach white dorms with sea views and rooms with windows looking onto endless blue skies. A herb garden where bees hum away the lazy summer days invite a stroll or an afternoon spent reading, and the pub has one of the best views in the world, where Annie’s food goes perfectly with ice cold drinks and a game of pool.

The beach is a stone’s throw away from the viewing decks, where early morning viewings between May and November will tempt you to wake earlier to watch the whales just beyond the surf.

Then it is off to the open air terrace at 9am for a delicious health breakfast, complete with a fresh baked muffin, before heading off for a day of adventure or rest.

There are loads to do - from horse riding and paragliding to hiking and surfing. , whether you are on a flying visit or intend to spend a few days recovering from a busy travel schedule, action, paragliding, kite surfing and dreamy days mix well in the Wilderness."
